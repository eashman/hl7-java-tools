 - HL7Encoding.java : Modified to qualify encoding characters in accordance
                      with the following reasonable constraints:
         - Must not be the same as any other encoding character. Precedence :
              field Separator,
              component separator,
              repetition separator,
              escape character,

        specification of encoding characters.
     Modified methods HL7Split(), Acknowledge(), IDString(), and
