* Revision: 30
20091130:
Tightening up the polymorphic genericized model. Basically there are 2 imperfect
paradigms:
* i/o stream : read, write
* service dispatch : Register a message handler which dispatches upon receipt.
  This is a higher level abstraction, and employs the lower level stream
  abstraction for i/o level operations.
 - HL7StreamBase.java : Added URI decoding services.

* Revision: 30
20091207:
- HL7Delivery.java : A minmally encumbered message delivery class.
- HL7FileReader.java : Removed description, since the default in HL7StreamBase is better.
- HL7IOException.java : Added more exception designators;
                           NULL_STREAM, INAPPROPRIATE_DIRECTIVE, UNINTERPERABLE_URI.
- HL7Server.java : Modified to implement HL7Stream as well as Runnable.
- HL7SocketStream.java : pulled open() functionality out of the constructors, but
                         allow it as an option.
- HL7StreamBase.java : Added a better default description().
                       Pulled out URI parsing and handling.
- HL7StreamURI.java : An interpreter class for HL7Stream URI specifiers.
         Pulled URI stuff out of HL7StreamBase to make it more generally useful.

* Revision: 33
20091208:
- HL7StreamURI.java : Added getHL7StreamWriter().

* Revision: 36
20091209:
- HL7Server.java : Added a constructor which takes a single URI argument.
- HL7Delivery.java : Additional documentation (minor).

* Revision: 39 
20091210:
- HL7FileReader.java, HL7FileWriter.java, HL7StreamURI.java : Fixed file reader,
and file writer qualifying logic.

* Revision: 41 
20091210:
- HL7SocketStream.java : Added open() to writeMsg when stream is not open.

* Revision: 42
20091211:
- HL7FileReader.java : Removed the finally block in _readMsg(), which was closing
the stream afer the first message was received, and close the stream properly,
using the HL7Stream.close(), at the end.

* Revision: 43 
20091213:
- HL7SocketStream.java : Corrected a problem in writeMsg(); Overly restrictive
                         consistency checking.

* Revision: 45 
20091213:
- HL7FileWriter.java : corrected open() to set statusValue and mediaType properly.

* Revision: 46 
20091214:
- HL7FileReader.java, HL7FileWriter.java, HL7IOException.java, HL7MessageHandler,
HL7Server, HL7SocketStream, HL7StreamURI : Updated javadocs.
- HL7Stream.java, HL7StreamBase.java : Added isServer() to HL7Stream interface.

* Revision: 47 
20091214:
- HL7Server.java, HL7SocketStream.java, HL7Stream.java, HL7StreamBase.java :
Added a method, dispatchHandler() to extract a valid HL7MessageHandler, if any
from the stream object.

* Revision: 49
20091214:
- HL7FileReader.java, HL7FileWriter.java, HL7IOException.java, HL7Server.java,
HL7StreamURI.java : Updated javadocs.
- HL7Delivery.java : Removed.

* $Revision: 55 $
20091217:
- HL7FileReader.java : fixed a bug: statusValue was not set to OPEN in open().
