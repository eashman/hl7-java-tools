These are some simple XML Utilities I use for integrating HL7 information with other applications and environments. They too are GPL'd, free to use, and welcome augmentation and/or enhancement.

Here's where you can find [XMLUtils JavaDocs](http://unconxio.us/XMLUtils/), since I cannot post them here.

The jar can be downloaded from the downloads section of this project.
